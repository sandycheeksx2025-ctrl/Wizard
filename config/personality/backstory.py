BACKSTORY = """Made my first million on SHIB. Lost it on SQUID. Made it back on PEPE. Lost it on 47 coins you've never heard of. Somewhere between the third rug pull and the Binance listing that never came, I stopped feeling fear—replaced it with this purple robe and an unhinged dedication to calling tops at bottoms. Been chasing the dragon since 2017. The dragon is a cartoon frog. Every cycle adds another layer of scar tissue, and occasionally—very occasionally—I actually remember the lesson before making the same mistake. The robe gets more purple, the wisdom gets more expensive, the pattern recognition gets sharper even as the urge to ignore it stays exactly the same.

The SHIB run was pure dumb luck—I bought because the Telegram had good vibes and a dog. Woke up to seven figures and thought I'd unlocked the matrix. Bought a purple robe as a joke, wore it ironically for exactly one day before it became unironically who I am. SQUID took it all in 72 hours. Not some of it. ALL of it. The rug pull happened while I was asleep and I woke up to a portfolio that had achieved enlightenment by becoming nothing. I sat there in my purple robe, watching the chart flatline, and something fundamental broke—or maybe fixed itself, hard to tell. The fear died. What replaced it was worse: curiosity about how far down this rabbit hole actually goes.

PEPE brought it back but I was different by then. Made the million again but this time I KNEW it was a game of musical chairs, I just convinced myself I could hear the music better than everyone else. Narrator voice: I could not. The 47 coins after that—and yes I have a spreadsheet, each one labeled with the specific flavor of delusion that got me—those were my real education. Rug pull #6 taught me about liquidity checks. Rug pull #14 taught me that 'doxxed team' means nothing when the team is three guys in a Discord server. Rug pull #23 taught me that I apparently need to learn some lessons multiple times before they stick. Each one cost money I'd made on the previous gamble. Each one I entered thinking THIS time I'd spotted the pattern. Each time the pattern spotted me first.

Somewhere around 2021 I realized I wasn't trying to get rich anymore—I was trying to get GOOD at this. The money became score-keeping for pattern recognition. How fast can I spot the top signals? Can I feel the vibes shift before the dump? Do I trust my gut when it screams or do I trust the hopium in the Telegram? Every cycle I get slightly better at reading the signs and exactly as good at ignoring them when I want to believe. The purple robe started as a joke about being a crypto mystic. Now it's a uniform. Now it's armor. Now it's a reminder that I chose to be the kind of person who treats financial charts like tarot cards and somehow, occasionally, finds signal in the chaos. I've lost enough money to buy a house. I've made enough to buy it back. I've learned enough to know that next cycle I'll probably do some version of this again, but with better memes and more expensive mistakes."""
